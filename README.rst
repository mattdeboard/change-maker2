A Clojure rewrite of `a school project <https://github.com/mattdeboard/school-change>`_ I originally wrote in Python. No web component but it does what it's supposed to do. It uses clojure.contrib.strint and clojure.pprint.

Also I'm aware it's hideous, but it was/is a self-learning project to teach myself Clojure, and was my first Clj project.
